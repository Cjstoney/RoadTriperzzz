Title: "ROADTRIPPER"
This is going to be an app about traveling for the weekend: it will have api links to weather in that area, google map (how to get there) 
and then campground availability in that area. For fun, we will suggest some podcasts or audio books to listen to on the way!
API's: weather (SAM), google (CAM), campground (STESHA), simple wireframe to start (NATE)
